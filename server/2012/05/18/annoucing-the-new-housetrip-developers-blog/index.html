<h2 id='about_housetrip'>About HouseTrip</h2>

<p>HouseTrip was founded in 2009 by Arnaud Bertrand and Junjun Chen. Arnaud and Junjun met whilst studying hospitality management at the acclaimed Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The HouseTrip concept was born as a result of a mutual love of staying in holiday rentals while travelling. The trigger event occurred whilst trying to book a rental for a weekend in Scotland, with a booking process that was so complicated that they decided to dedicate themselves to making it simpler. Their thinking was; &#8220;since rentals are better value and more &#8216;authentic&#8217; than hotels, if it’s easier and safer to book rentals, more people will choose them over hotels.&#8221; Given HouseTrip&#8217;s early success, this has so far held true!</p>
