  Having all members of the team write code with a similar style is important, for the sake of readability. Here's how we try to achieve this.

Here at HouseTrip we are quite a big team and it's difficult to keep track of
everything that's going on. However we truly believe that code style guides helps us
moving forward:

- They make sure everyone is in the same mindset
- They raise code quality by preventing code-smells or bad decisions
- They allow new developers to catch up with existing code
- They can teach a trick or too

In the beginning it feels like you are following a tight process but
as soon as you comprehend the rules, you end up being very productive and coding
flows naturally.

The main point here for us is that only with these guides we
make sure the thousands of lines of code produced every week are homogenous
through all our components - main web app, services, devops, frontend & backend
code etc..

Today we would like to share with you, all our code style guides:
