Data Context Interaction is recently invented programming paradigm, which aims at separating behaviour from data model, by extracting interactions into roles, which can be played by objects in various contexts. 

On 13th of May 2013 we gave a talk about DCI at London Ruby User Group (LRUG). Presentation gave brief introduction to DCI, proposed ways to implement roles' injection in Ruby and discussed how DCI could be used to supplement Rails' MVC paradigm.
