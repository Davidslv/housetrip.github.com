Many of our tests tend to use live ActiveRecord objects, which means the
database can be a speed bottleneck when running a test suite. Even with good
SSDs, the heavy, synchronous I/O performed when creating records is a grind.

A common idea is to make your test database's storage live in memory instead
of on-disk, and that's exactly what [mrd](https://github.com/mezis/mrd) sets
up for you

Yes, it's pronounced like the french swear wordâ€”sorry it might be poor
taste. The rationale there is that you might end up that word a lot (or the
equivalent in your own language) after setting up MySQL-in-a-RAMdisk
manually a couple of times.

Set up is trivial; just install:

    $ gem install mrd
    Successfully installed mrd-0.0.3
    1 gem installed

and run:

    $ mrd
    ==>
    Created Ramdisk at /dev/disk4
    Formatted Ramdisk at /dev/disk4
    Mounted Ramdisk at /Volumes/MySQLRAMDisk
    Starting MySQL server
    MySQL is now running.
    Configure you client to use the root user, no password, and the socket at '/Volumes/MySQLRAMDisk/mysql.sock'.
    Just close this terminal or press ^C when you no longer need it.

Then, if using Rails, point your `database.yml` to the temporary SQL server:
  
    test:
      ...
      socket: /Volumes/MySQLRAMDisk/mysql.sock

Don't forget to setup your test database:

    $ bundle exec rake db:create:all db:test:prepare

Voila! Slightly faster tests.

A couple of caveats to finish:

- `mrd only support MacOS, but you're very welcome to fork & extend for Linux
  `support!
- This is a hastily hacked together script. I've been using it for six months without problems though.
