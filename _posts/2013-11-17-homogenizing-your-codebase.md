Here at HouseTrip we are quite a big team and it's difficult to keep track of
everything that's going on. However we believe that if everyone follows the same
guidelines it will be much easier to jump in any part of our web app, our 
services or even our dev ops architecture. Guidelines are important, in the 
beginning it feels you are following a tight process but as soon as you 
comprehend the rules then you end up being very productive and outputting code
that not only will be more easily reviewed but more importantly minimizes the
legacy. 

One of our guidelines is that you should always follow our code style guides,
only this way can we make sure the thousands of lines of code we produce every
week are homogenous through all our components - main web app, services, devops,
frontend & backend code etc.. 

Today we would like to share with you all our code style guides with their
respective Github links:
